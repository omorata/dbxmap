* dbxmap
*dbxmap* is a tool for plotting astronomical maps from FITS files

The goal of the project is to be able to plot /any kind/ of astronomical map
from of a fits file (continuum maps, data cubes, etc) in a reasonably simple
way. *dbxmap* is a front end to APLpy for a set of pre-defined types of plots.

The plotting is controlled by a YAML configuration file that, at this moment,
allows to define, among other things:
  + output file
  + view of the data file
  + number of panels in the figure
  + plot data as a pixel map and/or as contours with, hopefully, full control
    on their definition
  + control over axes and tick properties
  + set labels on the panels
  + plot beam size of the data
  + show a colorbar with the pixel data range
  + overlay polygons, lines, ellipses and symbol markers, with associated
    labels


This is a work in progress and not all the planned functionalities are
implemented yet


** configuration file

The data is plotted using a YAML configuration file that contains the
definition of all the elements that should be in the map. The upper structure
of the file is divided into:
- a *page* section containing the general definition of the figure
- a *panels* section with the information that will be contained into the
  panel(s) of the plot. The structure of this section is, in general, divided
  into:
  - a part with definitions that will affect all panels
  - the definition of each panel

*** Page section
It may contain the entries:
- name :: name of the plot
- outfile :: name of the output file
- dpi :: dots per inch of the output file
- size :: two element list with the size in cm

*** Panels section
The /Panels/ section contains the definition of each desired panel, plus
optional options that affect all the panels. Some fields are:
- yx :: defining the panel grid. List of two values for the range in the /y/ and
        /x axes/.
- font :: definition of the default font
- view :: definition of the view of the map. Possible subfields:
  - type :: type of view selection: 'radius' or 'box'
  - center :: center position of the map. If not present, calculated from the
              reference position of the fits file
  - radius :: radius, in deg, for the /radius/ view 
- axes :: definition of axes properties
  - /axes_labels/
  - /ticks/
  - /tick_labels/
- labels :: definition of labels present in all panels
- contours :: contour definition for all panels
- pixrange :: pixel scale definition for all panels
- colorbar :: showing the range of a pixel range
- markers :: markers defined in all panels.
- panel-xx :: proper definition of panels. All must start with the string
              /panel/ and then some identifier  

*** panel definition
The /panel_xx/ definition controls how the data will be shown in each panel and
which other objects may be in it: 
- datasets :: by definition, each panel has to have the definition of at least
              one dataset
- colorbar :: showing the range of a pixel range
- view :: showing the view of the panel. If present, modifies any previous
          definitions
- labels :: adds labels to the panels. If present, adds to previously defined
            labels
